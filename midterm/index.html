        <p>now the question...</p>
        <h3>why ghibli?</h3>
        <p>i recommend studio ghibli because of its high quality animation and use of artistry to effectively tell stories. because of its resonant themes of love, family, and self-discovery. but also because it genuinely has such a cozy, peaceful, and almost <em>familiar</em> ambience to it. you also find a lot of comfort in the characters, too - with their unique quirks and cute designs (i love totoro, gigi, and no face). overall, watching a ghibli film is like hugging your mother or drinking a warm cup of tea, so i'd definitely recommend!</p>
