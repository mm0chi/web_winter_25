        <h2>pre-calculus</h2>
        <h3>dr. kaminsky</h3>
        <p>in pre-calculus so far, we've reviewed algebra 2, learned conic sections, trigonometric functions, the unit circle, trigonometric identities and algebraic proofs. we've had two projects so far: financial and trigonometric modeling, and we have another that we're currently doing as the final. i like math as i can rely on it to always present a logical solution. everything works, and everything just makes sense. i think it's one of the most unique subjects, as it requires a very unique style of thinking that utilizies a combination of logic, problem solving, visualiziation, and creative and critical thinking.</p>

        <h2>web</h2>
        <h3>ms. hollingshead</h3>
        <p>in web so far, we've learned about the internet and how it works, and surface level html, css, and javascript. we've done one test on the internet, and a midterm project involving a 3-page website about a chosen topic. i like web because it involves a lot of coding and work with technology, which i am interested in. but i also like it for its creative aspect: designing and personalizing a website to your own liking, which i've been having a lot of fun doing, especially with the final (this one)!</p>

        <h2>scientific thinking 3</h2>
        <h3>mr. barrager</h3>
        <p>in scientific thinking 3 so far, we've learned about lab safety, states of matter, and astronomy, and lots more - we've actually touched on a very diverse range of topics. i like science because it really gets into how and why the world works, which i think is so fascinating, especially since the concepts we learn can be applied to everyday life. for example, we've recently learned about color and and how it is perceived. i find this interesting as color is a very applicable thing in our lives because we literally see it all the time!</p>
